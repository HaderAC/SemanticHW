### Code refactor HW

Week 1 HomeWork Assignment:

Clean code and add semantic elements

### OVERVIEW

In this HW we received an html and css file. Our goal was to clean up the code while mantaining the Look and responsiveness of it as it was presented. 

### CODE REFACTOR HIGHLIGHTS

1. Added semantic elements such as, Header, Article, Navigation, Aside and footer to the layout of the HTML code.

2. Changed the Title of the site to the name of the company so it would be destinguishable in the tab. 

3. Added alt atributes to the images so that a description would be visible if the image didn't load.

4. Followed practices for HTML/CSS practices.

5. Optimized CSS rules from 214 to 141 lines.
